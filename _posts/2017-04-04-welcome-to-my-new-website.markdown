Hello there! 

Welcome to my new website. I'm going to endeavor to keep a blog about my experience in my PhD, which is about mackerel collective behaviour. This project is heavy in modelling and computational work (read: I've had to learn how to program) and I'd like to be a resource for anyone interested in computational ecology and bioinformatics, but maybe aren't sure what tools are out there and how to start. I tought myself much of what I know (mostly R and Python) and though that might not be the best approach, if I can do it, sure as heck you can do it too.

On the side, I'm a scuba diver hoping to jump into these warm, tropical Irish waters soon. I'm also the student representative to the [Society for Conservation Biology Marine Section] and our next conference will be in Kuching, Malaysia.

If you're interested in marine ecology, conservation, data science, or just really like mackerel, come along with me on this journey!

Best,

-Sophia
